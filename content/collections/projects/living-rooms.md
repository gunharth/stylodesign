                text: 'Living Rooms was founded on a desire to meet the needs of the modern traveller, offering a hotel alternative that combines the luxury and services of a hotel with the privacy and space of home. Whether personalising space, servicing needs or simply inspiring with our local knowledge and resources, we place great value on all our guest relationships. We are proud that our brand awareness has grown organically, through word-of-mouth recommendations. Each part of the Living Rooms collection reflects not only the needs of our customers in terms of location and practicalities; they also meet their expectations when it comes to high-end design and technology. Each property is unique, created with the same care and attention to detail as would be paid to a private home. Each integrates the principles of the Living Rooms philosophy with the specific needs of our clientele.'
